//Draw a circle on the mouse (x,y) coordinates.

//Each time you move the mouse, draw a new circle.

//All the circles remain in the sketch until you press a mouse button.

//When you press a mouse button, the sketch is cleared and a single circle is drawn at the mouse (x,y) coordinates.

//If the LEFT button on the mouse is pressed, set the fill to black and draw a square. As soon as the LEFT button is released, gray fill the square.

//If the RIGHT button on the mouse is pressed, set the fill to white and draw a square. As soon as the RIGHT button is released, gray fill the square.

//If no mouse button is pressed, set the fill to gray and draw a square.
